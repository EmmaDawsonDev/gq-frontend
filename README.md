# geoQuizzr

GeoQuizzr is a location-based quiz game with checkpoints spread out around Stockholm, Sweden. Each checkpoint has a question attached and can be answered by the surroundings eg you might find the answer on a sign, a statue or the side of a building. The more questions you answer the more points you get.

This game is currently under development and is aiming to be released in May 2022. After that it will be open sourced.
